# Relevant Implications
### Functionality
Functionality involves ensuring that the outcome functions as intended. For this project, this means creating a playable Llama game which is easily playable with no bugs. This means that the program cannot crash on edge cases, must be able to handle all possible events, etc.

Functionality is important because user experience is the most important factor in a developed outcome, and if the outcome does not have basic functionality, users will become frustrated. Additionally, the program will have no real use, as it is not able to function for its intended task.

### Useability
Useability involves making it easy for the user to use the program without requiring help or assistance from others. For this project, this means making it simple to play, with intuitive controls and instructions that explain how the game works. This means everything must be designed so someone who has never touched a computer before would be able to play the game with as little of a learning curve as possible.

Useability is important because it is another key factor in the user experience. Users must feel like they understand the game, otherwise they will get frustrated and stop playing. This will result in the program not being used.

### Aesthetics
Aesthetics involves making the game appealing to look at. For this project, this involves using images for various parts of the game, such as the background, obstacles, and character.

Aesthetics is important because users appreciate it when games have appealing graphics, and it makes the game look much more professional and developed.

### Social
Social implications involve how the outcome affects users, and the wider community as a whole. Games which can be addictive need to have safeguards in place to stop users from spending too much time on the game. Another example is gambling games, which need safeguards to restrict how much the users can lose.

Social implications are important because games can have unintended negative consequences on their users.

Fortunately, the program which I will be creating is a very simple game, which means that additional safeguards will probably not need to be implemented to stop misuse of the game.
